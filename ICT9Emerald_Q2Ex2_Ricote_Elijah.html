	<h1>How to make Atomic Bomb</h1>
	<div id="topic1"><h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>Constructing an explosive device out of fertilizer and diesel fuel, or any other readily available materials, would require a significant level of knowledge and expertise. It would likely involve mixing the materials together in specific proportions in order to create a stable and powerful explosive. The exact process would depend on the specific materials used and the desired yield of the explosive.</p></div>

	<div id="topic2"><h1>Step One</h1>
		<p>Generally speaking, the first step in creating an explosive device would be to obtain the necessary materials. In this case, that would likely involve purchasing large quantities of fertilizer and diesel fuel from a farm supply store or other retail outlet, using specific proportions and mixing techniques in order to create a stable and powerful explosive. This would likely require some trial end error, as well as a thorough  understanding of the chemical reactions involved.</p></div>

	<div id="topic3"><h1>Step Two</h1>
		<p>Once the explosive mixture has been created, it would need to be placed inside a container or casing in order to create the explosive device. This could be done using a variety of methods, such as pecking the mixture into a pipe or other hollow container, or using a plastic or metal casing to hold the mixture in place. The exact method would depend on the materials and resources available, as well as the desired yield of the explosive.</p></div>
